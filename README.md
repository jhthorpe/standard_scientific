# standard_scientific 
Package that facilitates the representation and interpretation of data in scientific notation. The main features are two classes, the `SigFig` class and the `Scientific_Notation` class.  

## `SigFig`
This class is used to represent data with significant figures, and supports the usual operations (+,-,\*,/) with rules in place that ensure the correct number of figures in the result. It should be noted that the constructors generated by @dataclass should NOT be trusted to generate true "sigfigs", since they are just copying data. To generate a sigfig, it is *strongly* recommended that you use the `from_float` function to specify the value and the number of significant figures you want it to have.

## `Scientific_Notation`
Under construction.

## Requirements
    * pytest
    * python3.0 or later

## Installation
    `python3 -m pip install .`

## Import
    `import standard_scientific as si`
